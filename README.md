I created a Landing Page called ShelfWhispers, designed to introduce users to the world of BookTok and connect book lovers with trending reads. I built this using HTML and CSS, focusing on a structured layout and clean design. The page includes multiple sections like genres, book recommendations, trending BookTok videos, and a community section.
I used CSS for styling and layout, incorporating a gradient background, section-based design, and interactive buttons to enhance the visual appeal. The navigation is simple, and Iâ€™ve added buttons for exploring more and joining the community. 
This project helped me refine my HTML and CSS skills, experiment with layout structuring, and work on creating a visually engaging design.
